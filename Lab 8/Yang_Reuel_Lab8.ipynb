The benefit of character-based language models is their small vocabulary and flexibility in handling any words, punctuation, and other document structure.

        "- Thirdly, I increased the length of training epochs to 120, and it seemed to me that I was only able to reach maximum accuracy of 99.22%, so I stuck to the given 100.\n",
        "- Fourthly, I tried a different sequence length of 20 and that did not help the model, but I realized when I set it to 11, I was able to achieve a slightly better accuracy, but to run the \"generating text\" portion of the lab, I had to change it back to 10.\n",
        "- I also tried adding Dropout to check for any overfitting, and tried rates of 0.2, 0.1, and 0.4, and all those values made the model perform poorer than before, so I just commented them out.\n",
        "- In the end, the code I ended up with was able to successfully predict the first two given sequences of characters that the mdoel was trained on, but was unable to return something that makes sense for the third sequence of characters."
